In a tale quite bizarre, Dilpanta did roam,
Escaped from Tihar, where shadows find home.
He wandered the land with his knowledge so frail,
Teaching simple reactions, yet causing great wail.

With trousers hanging low and a smirk full of spite,
He puzzled the students both day and night.
Questions so complex, far beyond comprehension,
Leaving young minds in utter apprehension.

But hate followed Dilpanta, in whispers and jeers,
For his teaching brought chaos and unfounded fears.
A creature so strange, with his tricks and his games,
He reveled in their torment, enjoying their shame.

In the world of education, where clarity's dear,
Dilpanta's odd ways bred confusion and fear.
Yet within the madness, a lesson was found,
To persevere through challenges, on solid ground.

So here's to Dilpanta, though strange in his way,
A creature of havoc, who led minds astray.
In those loose-fitting pants, he left a dark stain,
Teaching hard-won wisdom through torment and pain.
